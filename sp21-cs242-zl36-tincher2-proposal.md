# A Website Check-In Framework
Eric Liu (zl36) | Moderator: Bailey Tincher (tincher2)

## Abstract
### Project Purpose
This is an automated framework that *interacts* with third-party websites and receives check-in rewards every day on behalf of the user.

### Project Motivation
I believe most daily check-in tasks are designed by internet companies to maintain MAU (monthly active user). To receive all awards every day, the user must visit all of the websites and spend a huge amount of time on this, which is not very productive. This project aims to free people from such repetitive works.
